  A holistic composting method that transforms high-risk organic waste into microbially active, food-safe compost using staged processes involving fermentation, aerobic breakdown, biochar, and microbial inoculants.

stages:
  - stage: Burn Hazardous Inputs
    method: Fire or electric composter
    materials:
      - Weeds (especially invasive or seeding)
      - Diseased garden waste
      - Bones (small and large)
      - Branches, twigs, logs
    output:
      - Charcoal (biochar)
      - Wood ash
    notes: >
      Preserve charcoal; weather both outputs before use to reduce pH and support microbial colonisation.

  - stage: Bokashi Bin (Fermentation)
    method: Anaerobic fermentation
    materials:
      - Kitchen scraps (meat, bread, dairy, small bones)
      - Clay soil (to bind toxins)
      - Charcoal and ash
      - Bokashi spray (EM solution)
    output:
      - Fermented waste
      - Leachate (dilute 1:100 to 1:200 as fertiliser)
    rotation: 4 bins on weekly cycle

  - stage: Tumbling Compost Bin
    method: Aerobic hot composting
    materials:
      - Fermented bokashi waste
      - Garden waste
      - High carbon browns (e.g. sawdust, leaves, paper)
    temperature_target: 50°C+
    duration: Variable, until broken down and no strong odour

  - stage: Curing Bin (Aerobin or passive bin)
    method: Maturation
    features:
      - Aerated ("lungs")
      - Moisture-balanced
    duration: 2–3 months
    signs_ready:
      - Earthy smell
      - Presence of mycorrhiza
      - No raw food remnants

  - stage: Worms or Crop Application
    options:
      - Feed to worms (vermicomposting)
      - Apply directly to garden
    safety_check: "Worms thriving indicates safe compost"

safety:
  general:
    - Always wash hands
    - Avoid direct skin or pet contact with leachate
    - Keep bins sealed from children and animals
  ergot_risk:
    - Avoid composting rye, barley, or seedy grass clippings
    - Remove wild mushrooms from compost
  pet_notes:
    - Keep pets away from compost and leachate
    - Signs of poisoning: hyperactivity, tremors, vomiting

environmental_benefits:
  - Carbon sequestration via biochar
  - Methane reduction by avoiding landfill
  - Microbial restoration of soil

septic_systems:
  safe_when:
    - Drains through leach field
    - Uses septic-safe cleaners
    - Avoids antibacterial or toxic inputs
  unsafe_when:
    - Overflowing tank
    - Compacted or poorly drained soil
    - Strong chemical use
