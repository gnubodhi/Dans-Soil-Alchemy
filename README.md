⚠️ **Health Warning**
If you have children or pets, make sure the bin is sealed and not leaking compost leachate. Compost bins and leachate are safe when used correctly, but it’s important to handle them carefully:

- **Bokashi Bin**: The contents of a properly managed bokashi bin (which includes kitchen scraps, small bones, etc.) are generally safe, but the bin should always be sealed to prevent contamination or leakage. Keep the bin out of reach of children and pets to avoid direct handling of waste.
- **Compost Leachate**: Leachate produced by compost bins, including those from tumbler bins that aren't sealed or aerobins with openings, can contain pathogens and should not be ingested. Always ensure these bins are properly sealed or positioned to prevent any leakage. If handled, wash hands thoroughly and avoid contact with skin, especially for children and pets.
- **Mushrooms**: Mushrooms (including magic and deathcap mushrooms) may grow in compost with a well-developed fungal network. If this occurs, remove them immediately. Be cautious about **wild mushrooms**, as some may be toxic. Always properly manage moisture and compost temperature to reduce fungal growth. But I have some strong mycelium growing that ate through a wooden sleeper retaining wall in a single year.
- **Bokashi Leachate**: The liquid produced by a bokashi bin (leachate) is safe to use as a fertiliser when diluted properly (1:100 to 1:200), but it shouldn’t be ingested. Avoid direct skin contact and ensure children or pets do not handle it. If touched, wash hands thoroughly.

## 🔥 Stage 1: Burn Hazardous Inputs or Use an Electric Composter

Some materials should be burned or put through an **electric composter** (expensive and high energy use) before composting to make them safe:
*Please note the electric composter can only handle small bones and branches (cut into smaller pieces to fit).*

- Dried **weeds** (especially if seeding or invasive)
- Diseased **garden waste**
- **Bones** (small and large)
- **Branches, twigs, logs**

✅ *Put the fire out before the branches become ash — the goal is to preserve charcoal (biochar), which is used throughout this composting method.*

This process produces **charcoal** and **wood ash**, which are added to compost at different stages, after letting them 'weather' to neutralise wood ash pH and allow microbiology to colonise the charcoal.

---

## 🪱 Bonus: Dog Poo Treatment

I recommend composting dog poo separately from food crops. You can try this method:

- Dig a hole and place a **bottomless bucket or worm tower** in the ground  
- Add dog poo with some **finished compost** to attract worms  
- Spray with **bokashi liquid** to aid fermentation and reduce odour/pathogens  
- Cover lightly with **soil or mulch**  
- Optionally add **charcoal and a small amount of ash** on top to further reduce odour and absorb ammonia  

This creates a **closed-loop system** for safely breaking down pet waste over time.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Fermenting dog waste **destroys harmful microbes and parasites**. If managed properly, it becomes a **safe soil amendment**. But never use it around food crops.

---

## 🧴 Stage 2: Reuse Your Bokashi Spray (DIY EM Mix)

Start with a store-bought bokashi spray bottle. When it's nearly empty, refill it with:

- Water treated with a **splash of lemon juice or another vitamin C source** (to dechlorinate)  
- **1 tsp molasses or treacle**  
- **1 tsp sugar**

Leave the cap **loose**, and let it ferment in a warm, dark place.

This creates a **live culture of Effective Microorganisms (EM)** for ongoing use.

Additionally, you can increase the microbial diversity in the spray by adding a small amount of bokashi leachate, fermented plant juice (I bokashi comfrey leaves), whey (liquid on top of yoghurt), or rice water.

I use a two-bottle system and go through a bottle once a week. That way I can have one fermenting and one for use.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Fermentation produces **low-pH conditions** that suppress harmful microbes and prevent spoilage.

---

## 🍖 Stage 3: Bokashi Bin – First Fermentation

Fill your bokashi bin with:

- Kitchen scraps: meat, seafood, small bones, bread, dairy, fats, etc.  
- A handful of **clay soil** (binds toxins and heavy metals)  
- **Charcoal and ash** from Stage 1  
- Spray each layer with bokashi solution  

The bin produces **leachate**: a nitrogen-rich organic liquid fertiliser containing beneficial microbes.  
🔸 Dilute **1:100 to 1:200** before applying to sensitive plants.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Bokashi Leachate is safe to dogs.

---

### 🔄 4-Bokashi Bin Rotation System

Use four bokashi bins filling with all kitchen waste on a weekly rotation:

1. Fill one bin per week  
2. Once full, ferment sealed for 4 weeks  
3. Empty the **oldest bin** into the compost tumbler when the current bin is full (4 weeks doesn't have to be exact, but longer is better).
4. Rinse and reset for use

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Bokashi microbes + charcoal + ash + clay = **pre-digested**, low-odour compost inputs with minimal contamination risk.

---

## ♻️ Stage 4: Tumbling Compost Bin – Aerobic Breakdown

Transfer fermented bokashi waste into a **tumbler bin**. You can also add:

- **Garden waste** (leaves, grass, trimmings) — no bokashi needed  
- A **large amount of brown material** for carbon balance:  
  - **Untreated sawdust** (from clean wood only)  
  - **Dried brown leaves** (safe and accessible)  
  - Shredded paper, straw, or mulch  

This stage introduces oxygen and supports **hot composting**.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Thermophilic microbes break down proteins and fats. **Temperatures above 50°C kill any remaining pathogens**.

---

## 🌿 Stage 5: Aerobin or Curing Bin (with Lungs)

Once compost is partially broken down and earthy-smelling, transfer to a **curing bin** (e.g. an Aerobin) with internal airflow for 2–3 months, length of time needed is dependent on moisture levels and temperature. This allows fungal growth in addition to the bacteria growth in earlier stages.

This allows the compost to stabilise fully. Check for even moisture and proper aeration. It should smell sweet and have the texture of a rainforest surface. I see mycorrhiza webs over the plain cardboard and wood chips in the bin.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Produces **fully mature compost** that’s safe for direct use on food crops. Nutrients are stabilised, acidity reduced.

---

## 🪱 Optional Stage 6: Worms or Crop Application

- **Feed to worms** to produce castings and further microbial enhancement  
- **Apply directly** to garden beds, trees, or crop rows  

🐛 **If worms are thriving in your compost, it's a clear sign that it's safe.**  
Worms are sensitive to toxins—so if they’re active and producing castings, you can be confident the compost is mature and safe for food crops.

### ✅ Safety Benefit
- Final compost is **fully cured, microbially rich**, and safe for use on edible plants—even root crops.  
- **pH stability:** Thanks to ample brown (carbon-rich) material and the prolonged curing stage, the compost’s pH moderates toward neutral—ideal for soil health.  
- **Complete transformation:** Inputs that were once risky for worms (e.g., high-protein scraps) have undergone heating, fermentation, and microbial digestion, converting them into a form that worms (and your garden) can safely enjoy.

---

## 🌍 Environmental Impact

This method is not only safe—it’s sustainable:

- **Biochar locks away carbon**: Charcoal remains in soil for centuries, improving fertility, microbial life, and moisture retention.
- **Avoids methane**: Landfilled organic waste decomposes anaerobically, releasing methane (25x worse than CO₂). This method prevents that.
- **Low emissions**: CO₂ released during composting is **biogenic**, not fossil-fuel derived—it was recently absorbed by plants.

### ✅ Summary:
You’re **converting waste into life**, not landfill. This is **composting with a conscience**.

## ⚠️ What Not to Do

- ❌ Don’t add **dog poo or unburnt bones** directly to main bin 
- ❌ Avoid sawdust from **treated or painted wood**  
- ❌ Don’t apply **unfinished compost** to food crops  
- ❌ Don’t forget **carbon balancing** — always add brown material

## 🚜 Scaling for Organic Farms

This method can be adapted for use on **certified organic farms** by omitting or substituting certain inputs:

### ✅ Suitable for Organic Systems
- Supports **closed-loop nutrient cycling** using on-site organic waste
- Enhances soil with **biochar**, **fermented microbes**, and **stable humus**
- Improves soil structure, water retention, and microbial health
- Reduces nutrient loss, odours, and pathogens

### 🔄 Adaptations for Certification
- Meat, dairy, and any non-organic materials
- Use only **untreated wood** for biochar and ash
- Ensure molasses, sugar, and food scraps are **certified organic**
- Compost must meet organic standards for **pathogen and seed kill** (e.g. 55°C for 15+ days)

With these adjustments, Dan’s Soil Alchemy can scale into a **farm-safe composting system** that aligns with **organic certification standards** such as ACO, NASAA, IFOAM, or USDA Organic. You could use some untreated wooden sleepers with stakes to hold compost in place and plant directly into it like a mulch!

🚫 Grain Seed Head Caution
If using manure or feed waste from non-organic sources, avoid adding rye, barley, or grass seed heads, especially if mouldy or damp. These may carry fungal spores like Claviceps purpurea (ergot).
✅ Burn or discard suspect material.
✅ Avoid adding mouldy grain hay, silage, or spilled feed.
✅ Use only well-digested manure or pre-treat with heat, fermentation, or bokashi.

## 🌾 Philosophy-Neutral, Soil-Positive

This method is about **reducing inputs** and **rebuilding soil health**, not enforcing a particular growing philosophy.

If you're using **chemical fertilisers or pesticides**, that's fine — this compost will still:
- **Feed your soil**
- **Improve structure and water retention**
- **Enhance microbial diversity**

Just be aware:  
🌱 The microbes introduced through bokashi, composting, and biochar may **go dormant** if soil conditions (e.g. chemical load, pH, or moisture) aren't ideal — but they’ll reawaken when conditions improve.

Whether you're **certified organic**, **conventional**, or somewhere in between, this method works to **recycle waste into living soil**.

## 🍄 Mushroom Theory

Mycelium serves as the soil's recycling system, and its fruiting bodies - mushrooms - may reflect not just species traits but also the quality and toxicity of what's decomposing. Toxins in soil don't always make mushrooms toxic, but certain mushrooms can absorb and even indicate the precence of toxins. By de-toxifying that area, a more diverse mushroom population may be able to grow. 

Some fungi—like Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushrooms)—can break down petrochemicals, plastics, and even cigarette butts. Others, like Mycena, absorb heavy metals from the soil. This process, known as mycoremediation, is being explored as a low-cost way to clean up polluted land.

In compost, wild mushrooms may signal that the fungal web is thriving. In fact, the types of mushrooms that grow can reflect the toxicity or fertility of the surrounding material. Over time, healthier soil supports a greater diversity of beneficial fungi—some of which may even deactivate toxins and support plant immunity.

In this way, mushrooms don’t just break down matter—they act as bioindicators and biohealers, reflecting and restoring soil health.

💩 **Shit Happens** — But That’s Not Always Bad
When septic systems are working properly, they don’t just dispose of waste — they support soil life. The system slowly releases effluent into a leach field, which acts as a biological sponge. Microbes in the soil (including beneficial bacteria and fungi) filter, neutralise, and recycle nutrients from the waste.

✅ What a Good Septic System Does:
Breaks down organic matter anaerobically in the tank

Filters effluent through aerobic soil layers

Supports microbial life that deactivates pathogens and recycles nitrogen

Improves soil structure around the leach field over time

⚠️ When It Goes Wrong:
Overloaded or failing tanks can leak raw sewage into shallow soil

Poor drainage or compaction suffocates soil microbes

Harsh cleaners (e.g. bleach, antibacterial soaps) kill the very microbes that process waste

Tree roots or cracked tanks cause contamination

🛠️ Tips to Support Soil Life in Septic Systems:
Use septic-safe cleaners (e.g. vinegar, EM, or Earth’s Choice-type products)

Avoid pouring oil, medication, or antibacterial agents down the drain

Pump your tank every few years to prevent overflow

Maintain healthy ground cover over the leach field (not hardscape)

🐜 Termites vs. Fungi: Who Breaks Down the Wood?
In healthy compost systems rich in fungi, termites may become less of a problem—but it depends on the balance.

✅ When Fungi Win
Certain fungi, such as white-rot and brown-rot fungi, can:

Rapidly colonise and break down wood, leaving it too degraded for termites to prefer.

Alter moisture and chemical composition of the wood, making it less palatable.

Outcompete insects by producing antimicrobial or antifungal compounds.

If your system has strong mycelial activity (like the kind that ate through my wooden retaining wall in a year), you're likely managing a highly efficient fungal network that is already recycling wood faster than termites can get to it.

❌ But Not a Full Repellent
Termites aren't always deterred:

Some termites actually farm fungi (e.g. Termitomyces) and thrive in decaying environments.

If the fungus dies off or slows down, termites may move into the softened wood.

Coexistence is possible in humid, nutrient-rich environments.

🛠️ Tips for Termite-Resistant Garden Structures
To protect wooden infrastructure:

Use charred wood (shou sugi ban method) to deter termites and fungi alike.

Avoid placing untreated wood in contact with soil, especially if using fresh logs.

Choose less-palatable wood species for in-ground use (e.g. casuarina, eucalyptus).

In hugelkultur beds, ensure aerobic breakdown dominates by mixing in brown material and turning periodically.

📌 Summary:
Strong fungal ecosystems can shift the balance away from termites by outcompeting them and transforming wood in less favorable ways. It’s not about elimination—it’s about creating a microbial-first composting system that breaks down organic matter your way.
