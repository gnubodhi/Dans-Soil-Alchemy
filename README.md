**Simple yet powerful composting method**

Welcome to a sustainable, safe, and high-yield composting system. This method is designed to turn even high-risk organic waste into a nutrient-rich, microbially active compost that's safe for use on food crops—while reducing your environmental impact.

⚠️ Note:
This is a general guide based on my personal experience. I can't account for your exact conditions, so please use your judgment and research when composting — especially when it comes to safety. I can’t take responsibility for any health issues or harm caused by incorrect composting.

## 🔥 Stage 1: Burn Hazardous Inputs

Some materials should be burned before composting to make them safe:

- Dried **weeds** (especially if seeding or invasive)
- Diseased **garden waste**
- Large **bones**
- **Branches, twigs, logs**

✅ *Put the fire out before the branches become ash — the goal is to preserve charcoal (biochar), which is used throughout this composting method.*

This process produces **charcoal (biochar)** and **wood ash**, which are added to later stages.

## 🪱 Bonus: Dog Poo Treatment

I recommend composting dog poo serperately away from food crops. You can try this method:

- Dig a hole and place a **bottomless bucket or worm tower** in the ground  
- Add dog poo with some **finished compost** to attract worms  
- Spray with **bokashi liquid** to aid fermentation and reduce odour/pathogens  
- Cover lightly with **soil or mulch**  
- Optionally add **charcoal and a small amount of ash** on top to further reduce odour and absorb ammonia  

This creates a **closed-loop system** for safely breaking down pet waste over time.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Fermenting dog waste **destroys harmful microbes and parasites**. If managed properly, it becomes a **safe soil amendment**. But never use it around food crops.

---

## 🧴 Stage 2: Reuse Your Bokashi Spray (DIY EM Mix)

Start with a store-bought bokashi spray bottle. When it's nearly empty, refill it with:

- Water treated with a **splash of lemon juice or another vitamin C source** (to dechlorinate)  
- **1 tsp molasses or treacle**  
- **1 tsp sugar**

Leave the cap **loose**, and let it ferment in a warm, dark place.

This creates a **live culture of Effective Microorganisms (EM)** for ongoing use.

Additionally, you can increase the microbial diversity in the spray by adding a small amount of bokashi leachette, fermented plant juice (I bokashi comfrey leaves), whey (liquid ontop yoghurt) or rice water.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Fermentation produces **low-pH conditions** that suppress harmful microbes and prevent spoilage.

---

## 🍖 Stage 3: Bokashi Bin – First Fermentation

Fill your bokashi bin with:

- Kitchen scraps: meat, seafood, small bones, bread, dairy, fats, etc.  
- A handful of **clay soil** (binds toxins and heavy metals)  
- **Charcoal and ash** from Stage 1  
- Spray each layer with bokashi solution  

The bin produces **leacheate**: a nitrogen-rich organic liquid fertiliser containing beneficial microbes.  
🔸 Dilute **1:100 to 1:200** before applying to sensitive plants.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Bokashi Leachette is safe to dogs.

---

### 🔄 4-Bokashi Bin Rotation System

Use four bokashi bins on a weekly rotation:

1. Fill one bin per week  
2. Once full, ferment sealed for 4 weeks  
3. Empty the **oldest bin** into the compost tumbler when the current bin is full (4 weeks doesn't have to be exact, but longer is better).
4. Rinse and reset for use

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Bokashi microbes + charcoal + ash + clay = **pre-digested**, low-odour compost inputs with minimal contamination risk.

---

## ♻️ Stage 4: Tumbling Compost Bin – Aerobic Breakdown

Transfer fermented bokashi waste into a **tumbler bin**. You can also add:

- **Garden waste** (leaves, grass, trimmings) — no bokashi needed  
- A **large amount of brown material** for carbon balance:  
  - **Untreated sawdust** (from clean wood only)  
  - **Dried brown leaves** (safe and accessible)  
  - Shredded paper, straw, or mulch  

This stage introduces oxygen and supports **hot composting**.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Thermophilic microbes break down proteins and fats. **Temperatures above 50°C kill any remaining pathogens**.

## ⚠️ Health Warning
If  you have children or pets, make sure the bin is sealed and not leaking compost leachette.
---

## 🌿 Stage 5: Aerobin or Curing Bin (with Lungs)

Once compost is partially broken down and earthy-smelling, transfer to a **curing bin** (e.g. an Aerobin) with internal airflow for 2–3 months.

This allows the compost to stabilise fully.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Produces **fully mature compost** that’s safe for direct use on food crops. Nutrients are stabilised, acidity reduced.

---

## 🪱 Optional Stage 6: Worms or Crop Application

- **Feed to worms** to produce castings and further microbial enhancement  
- **Apply directly** to garden beds, trees, or crop rows  

🐛 **If worms are thriving in your compost, it's a clear sign that it's safe.**  
Worms are sensitive to toxins—so if they’re active and producing castings, you can be confident the compost is mature and safe for food crops.

### ✅ Safety Benefit
- Final compost is **fully cured, microbially rich**, and safe for use on edible plants—even root crops.  
- **pH stability:** Thanks to ample brown (carbon-rich) material and the prolonged curing stage, the compost’s pH moderates toward neutral—ideal for soil health.  
- **Complete transformation:** Inputs that were once risky for worms (e.g., high-protein scraps) have undergone heating, fermentation, and microbial digestion, converting them into a form that worms (and your garden) can safely enjoy.

## 🌍 Environmental Impact

This method is not only safe—it’s sustainable:

- **Biochar locks away carbon**: Charcoal remains in soil for centuries, improving fertility, microbial life, and moisture retention.
- **Avoids methane**: Landfilled organic waste decomposes anaerobically, releasing methane (25x worse than CO₂). This method prevents that.
- **Low emissions**: CO₂ released during composting is **biogenic**, not fossil-fuel derived—it was recently absorbed by plants.

### ✅ Summary:
You’re **converting waste into life**, not landfill. This is **composting with a conscience**.

## ⚠️ What Not to Do

- ❌ Don’t add **dog poo or unburnt bones** directly to main bin 
- ❌ Avoid sawdust from **treated or painted wood**  
- ❌ Don’t apply **unfinished compost** to food crops  
- ❌ Don’t forget **carbon balancing** — always add brown material

## 🚜 Scaling for Organic Farms

This method can be adapted for use on **certified organic farms** by omitting or substituting certain inputs:

### ✅ Suitable for Organic Systems
- Supports **closed-loop nutrient cycling** using on-site organic waste
- Enhances soil with **biochar**, **fermented microbes**, and **stable humus**
- Improves soil structure, water retention, and microbial health
- Reduces nutrient loss, odours, and pathogens

### 🔄 Adaptations for Certification
- Meat, dairy, and any non-organic materials
- Use only **untreated wood** for biochar and ash
- Ensure molasses, sugar, and food scraps are **certified organic**
- Compost must meet organic standards for **pathogen and seed kill** (e.g. 55°C for 15+ days)

With these adjustments, Dan’s Soil Alchemy can scale into a **farm-safe composting system** that aligns with **organic certification standards** such as ACO, NASAA, IFOAM, or USDA Organic. You could use some untreated wooden sleepers with stakes to hold compost in place and plant directly into it like a mulch!

## 🌾 Philosophy-Neutral, Soil-Positive

This method is about **reducing inputs** and **rebuilding soil health**, not enforcing a particular growing philosophy.

If you're using **chemical fertilisers or pesticides**, that's fine — this compost will still:
- **Feed your soil**
- **Improve structure and water retention**
- **Enhance microbial diversity**

Just be aware:  
🌱 The microbes introduced through bokashi, composting, and biochar may **go dormant** if soil conditions (e.g. chemical load, pH, or moisture) aren't ideal — but they’ll reawaken when conditions improve.

Whether you're **certified organic**, **conventional**, or somewhere in between, this method works to **recycle waste into living soil**.
