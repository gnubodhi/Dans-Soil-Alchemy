Simple yet powerful composting method

Welcome to a sustainable, safe, and high-yield composting system. This method is designed to turn even high-risk organic waste into a nutrient-rich, microbially active compost that's safe for use on food crops—while reducing your environmental impact.

---

## 🔥 Stage 1: Burn Hazardous Inputs

Some materials should be burned before composting to make them safe:

- Dried **dog poo**
- Dried **weeds** (especially if seeding or invasive)
- Diseased garden waste
- Large **bones**
- Branches, twigs, logs

This produces **charcoal (biochar)** and **wood ash**, which are added to the compost process.

### ⚠️ Note on Burning Dog Poo:
Burning dried dog poo helps sterilise it, but may release **airborne particles and bacteria**. Only burn in a well-ventilated outdoor space away from people and pets. Do **not** burn wet or fresh dog poo. I use paperbags from my shopping to reduce particiles entering the air. I then put the paper bag at the very bottom of the fire and put sticks and other material ontop.

### 🪱 Alternative: Dog Poo Treatment Without Burning
If you don’t want to burn dog poo:
- Dig a hole and place a **bottomless bucket or worm tower** in the ground
- Add dog poo with some **finished compost** to attract worms
- Spray with **bokashi liquid** to aid fermentation and reduce odour/pathogens
- Cover lightly with soil or mulch
- Cover with ash and charcoal to eliminate ordour

This creates a **closed-loop system** for safely breaking down pet waste over time.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Burning or fermenting dog waste **destroys harmful microbes and parasites**. If managed correctly, it can become a **safe soil amendment**.

## 🧴 Stage 2: Reuse Your Bokashi Spray (DIY EM Mix)

Start with a store-bought bokashi spray bottle, then:

1. Refill with:
   - Water treated with **a splash of lemon juice** (to dechlorinate)
   - 1 tsp **molasses or treacle**
   - 1 tsp **sugar**
2. Leave the cap loose, ferment in a warm place

This creates a **live culture of Effective Microorganisms (EM)** for ongoing fermentation.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Fermentation produces **low-pH conditions** that suppress harmful microbes and prevent spoilage.

---

## 🍖 Stage 3: Bokashi Bin – First Fermentation

Fill your bokashi bin with:

- Kitchen scraps: meat, seafood, small bones, bread, dairy, fats, etc.
- A handful of **clay soil** (to bind toxins)
- **Charcoal and ash** (from Stage 1)
- Spray each layer with bokashi solution
- The bin produces a leachette which is a powerful nitrogen based organic liquid fertiliser packed with beneficial microbes which can be applied to crops. It is highly acidic so you will want to dillute it 1:100 or 1:200 for sensitive plants.

### 🔄 Recommended: 4-Bokashi Bin Rotation System

Use four bokashi bins on a weekly rotation:
- Fill one per week
- Once full, let it ferment sealed for 4 weeks
- Empty the **oldest** bin into the compost tumbler
- Rinse and reset it for use

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Combining bokashi microbes with charcoal, ash, and clay **pre-digests waste** and **binds potential contaminants**, making it stable and low-odour.

---

## ♻️ Stage 4: Tumbling Compost Bin – Aerobic Breakdown

Transfer fermented bokashi waste into a **tumbler bin**. You can also add:

- **Garden waste** (leaves, grass, trimmings) — skip the bokashi stage
- A large amount of **brown material** for carbon balance:
  - **Untreated sawdust** (check with local furniture makers)
  - **Dried brown leaves** (safest and most accessible)
  - Shredded paper, straw, mulch

This stage introduces oxygen and allows **hot composting**.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Thermophilic microbes break down proteins and fats, and **temperatures above 50°C kill any remaining pathogens**.

---

## 🌿 Stage 5: Aerobin or Curing Bin (with Lungs)

Once your compost is breaking down and smelling earthy, transfer it to a **curing bin** (e.g. an Aerobin) with ventilation for 2–3 months.

This stage allows microbes to **stabilise nutrients** and eliminate any leftover acidity from fermentation.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Fully mature compost that is **safe to use on food crops**, with stable nutrients and minimal risk of plant burn.

---

## 🪱 Optional Stage 6: Worms or Crop Application

- **Feed to worms** to produce castings and further microbial enhancement  
- **Apply directly** to garden beds or trees as mulch or soil amendment
- If worms are thriving eating the compost, it's a strong sign the material is safe.
Worms are sensitive to toxins — so if they're active and producing castings, you can be confident that your compost is mature, microbially balanced, and safe for food crops.

### ✅ Safety Benefit:
Compost is now fully cured, microbially active, and **safe for direct contact with edible plants**.

## 🌍 Environmental Impact

This method is not only safe—it's sustainable:

- **Biochar locks away carbon**: Charcoal is a stable carbon structure that remains in soil for centuries, improving fertility and structure.
- **Avoids methane**: Organic waste in landfill decomposes anaerobically, releasing methane (25x more potent than CO₂). This method avoids that.
- **Low emissions**: Any CO₂ released during decomposition comes from plant material—not fossil fuels. Most of the carbon was originally absorbed from the air.

### ✅ Summary:
You're **converting waste into life**, not landfill. This is composting with a conscience.

## 📋 Safety Summary

| Stage | Purpose | How It Makes Compost Safer |
|-------|---------|----------------------------|
| 🔥 Burn | Sterilise waste | Destroys pathogens, seeds, and bones |
| 🧴 EM Mix | Maintain microbes | Ferments waste, prevents spoilage |
| 🍖 Bokashi Bin | Anaerobic digestion | Suppresses pathogens, locks in odours |
| ♻️ Tumbler | Aerobic hot compost | Heats up and sanitises further |
| 🌿 Curing Bin | Final breakdown | Stabilises for safe plant use |
| 🪱 Worms/Crops | Optional use | Ready for soil or worm castings |

## ⚠️ What Not to Do

- ❌ Don’t add **fresh dog poo** or **unburnt bones** directly
- ❌ Avoid sawdust from **treated or painted wood**
- ❌ Don’t apply **unfinished** compost to food crops
- ❌ Don’t forget carbon balancing—**always add brown material**
