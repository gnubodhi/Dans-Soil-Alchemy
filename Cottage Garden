Making a Beautiful Garden in degraded clay subsoil

Step 1: Assess & Clear the Area
Remove as much degraded soil as possible while being careful not to disturb established plants.

Clear the area of any weeds, invasive plants, or unnecessary debris, but leave the established plants intact.

Step 2: Improve Soil Structure
Mix the degraded subsoil with amendments and sandy soil to improve its texture and create a loamy mixture:

Compost: Rich in organic matter, compost will help introduce essential nutrients and microbial life to the soil.

Carbon sources: Add wood chips, straw, or dried leaves to introduce slow-decomposing carbon material for soil enrichment.

Sand: If your subsoil is heavy clay, mix in sand to improve drainage. However, be cautious about adding too much, as it could create a sandy soil instead of the desired loamy texture.

Charcoal (Biochar): This will help improve soil structure, retain moisture, and provide a habitat for beneficial microbes.

Gypsum: Useful for breaking up compacted soils, helping to improve aeration and prevent the soil from becoming too hard.

Zeolite: If the soil is sandy, zeolite will help retain moisture and nutrients.

Coco coir: Add coco coir for moisture retention, particularly in sandy soils, and hydrate it well after adding it to the mix.

Step 3: Blend the Subsoil and Amendments
Combine the degraded subsoil, sandy soil, and amendments in a ratio that suits the needs of your garden. The goal is to create a texture similar to loam but with a slight clay tendency.

Use approximately 1 part sandy soil to 2 parts degraded subsoil and mix in amendments until the texture is crumbly and well-mixed.

The clay content will provide better moisture retention and nutrient holding capacity, which is beneficial for plants over time.

Ensure the organic matter is evenly distributed to enrich the soil and encourage microbial colonization.

Step 4: Create a Hugelkultur-Style Foundation
Dig a trench or hole to incorporate organic material such as logs or large branches at the bottom, particularly if termites are not an issue.

Logs will decompose over time, providing organic matter and improving the soil in the long run.

If termites are a concern, you can use garden waste (such as shredded branches or leaves), mixed with a small amount of soil to prevent sludging.

Step 5: Add Organic Matter and Mulch
Layer your amendments on top of the freshly mixed soil and cover it with mulch, such as straw, wood chips, or grass clippings. This will:

Help retain moisture in the soil.

Suppress weeds and reduce soil erosion.

Promote microbial life in the topsoil as it breaks down.

Step 6: Plant Your Garden
Plant your garden with a mix of native and imported flowers, food crops, and plants that bring you joy, such as chillies and fruit trees. You can even top fruit trees to fit them into a small backyard space.

Create an ecosystem: The goal is to design a space that attracts beneficial microbes, insects, and worms, fostering a thriving and diverse environment. Include:

Native plants to support local ecosystems.

Food crops for your own consumption, such as vegetables, herbs, and fruits.

Flowers and ornamental plants that attract pollinators and beneficial insects.

Step 7: Monitor & Adjust
Monitor soil health regularly. If the soil dries out too quickly, add more organic matter or mulch. If it stays too wet, you can adjust drainage by incorporating more sand or other materials that improve soil aeration.

Top up with compost or garden waste as needed to maintain a healthy, thriving garden.
